# Galatea

- Explain why session methods are sync

---

## Inputs

- Infinite vertical scroll – pages still
- Erase any finite container for a story
- Take over the role of the given character
- When someone assumes a role, they need to be aligned with the character
- God view / narration / story swiping -> character move -> responding character thought -> role play (role play acts as
  chapter mark / whatever and is searchable)
- Opposite -> behavior -> figure out what the thought was (both inferring thought from action and injecting thought to
  elicit action)
- the thoughts you inject are persistent, dependent on the power of the thought
- we need a thought classification mechanism
- more you abide by philosphy of the character the more points you earn
- have to work within the confines of the dynamic. Woman just got cuffed by the cop. What do you do?
- inject thoughts into peoples heads
- learn empathy through story telling
- if you do the wrong thing, the story has consequences
- certain number of rewinds incase you really mess up
- you actually form relationships with the characters/content you consume
- you have to know the rules of the world
- once it's generated, it's fixed
- interactivity on/off toggle
- how much interactivity does a parent want
- smaller is better, we can always expand scope
- Ambient vs. playable characters
- Environment -> ask AI "describe the environment x"
- Introduce randomness to thought patterns
- Options re. movement
- Chicken or egg – thoughts affecting actions affecting thoughts
- Positive self-talk
- Different characters have different levels of patience / temperaments
- Environment and storyline informs thoughts (granted we then need to know what any given character is aware of)
- Apply filters to characters / decide on playable characters
- No mundane interactions – characters have autonomy and can reject you
- Tool for parents to teach kids about how to socialize
- Characters having secrets of which the player is unaware
